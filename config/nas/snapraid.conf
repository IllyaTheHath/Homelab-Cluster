# Defines the file to use as parity storage
# It must NOT be in a data disk
# Format: "parity FILE [,FILE] ..."
parity Z:\SnapRAID\snapraid.parity

# Defines the files to use as additional parity storage.
# If specified, they enable the multiple failures protection
# from two to six level of parity.
# To enable, uncomment one parity file for each level of extra
# protection required. Start from 2-parity, and follow in order.

# Defines the files to use as content list
# You can use multiple specification to store more copies
# You must have least one copy for each parity file plus one. Some more don't hurt
# They can be in the disks used for data, parity or boot,
# but each file must be in a different disk

# Automatically save the state when syncing after the specified amount

# Defines the pooling directory where the virtual view of the disk

# symbolic links.
# This directory must be outside the array.
# Format: "pool DIR"
#pool C:\\pool

# Defines the Windows UNC path required to access disks from the pooling
# directory when shared in the network.
# If present (uncomment to enable), the symbolic links created in the
# pool virtual view, instead of using local paths, are created using the
# specified UNC path, adding the disk names and file path.
# This allows to share the pool directory in the network.
# See the manual page for more details.
